# Dinosaur-runner
Dinosaur-runner resembles the popular T-rex game that appears in browsers when the Internet is not working. 

The dinosaur can jump or crouch in order to avoid the cactuses or birds that are moving towards it. The game finishes when the dinosaur hits a cactus or a bird, but the player can start another round.
The game keeps also track of the time played within a round and displays the record. After a certain time, the speed of the obstacles increases.

The jump movement uses a global iterator through which the ascension and descension phases were implemented. Until a certain time, the only obstacles are cactuses, but after that, the birds also appear.
At this moment, the type of the new obstacle generated is chosen by using a "Math.random()" function.
